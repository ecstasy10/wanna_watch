# wanna watch?

I started this project on _vanilla JS_, then I switched to _VUE.js_ to make it better, so I had to learn how to use it. I saw many tutorials & forums, probably the way i use it isn't the correct one, but I'm just a begginer.

The Web App implements Ajax tech, Bootstrap deployed with Vue.

## Build Setup

``` bash
# install dependencies

npm install -g webpack-cli
